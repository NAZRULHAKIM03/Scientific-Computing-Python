Scientific Computing with Python

This repository contains all the lesson exercises and practice code from the Scientific Computing with Python course by FreeCodeCamp.

Each folder contains code written during the lessons

This repository is separate from my scientific-computing-python-projects repo, where I store the five final projects required for certification.
