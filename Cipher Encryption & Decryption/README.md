Vigenere Cipher

A simple Python implementation of the Vigenere Cipher, a method of encrypting and decrypting text using a keyword-based shifting technique.

Features
	•	Encrypts plaintext using a keyword.
	•	Decrypts ciphertext back into readable text.
	•	Handles uppercase and lowercase letters.

How It Works

The Vigenere Cipher shifts each letter of the plaintext based on the corresponding letter in the repeating keyword. The shift is determined by the position of the keyword letter in the alphabet.
