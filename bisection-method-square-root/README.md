Bisection Method Square Root Finder

A simple Python program that approximates the square root of a number using the Bisection Method.

Features
    • Finds the square root of a given number using numerical approximation
    • Handles positive numbers, zero, and special cases
    • Allows adjustable tolerance and iteration limits for precision control
    • Provides an error message if convergence fails

How It Works

The program starts with a range [low, high] that contains the square root of the target number. It repeatedly selects the midpoint, checks its square, and adjusts the range accordingly until the approximation is within the given tolerance.
